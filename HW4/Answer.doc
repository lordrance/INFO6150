Typography Choice

Font: Roboto from Google Fonts for body text and Merriweather for headings.

Reasoning: Roboto offers a clean, modern sans-serif design that ensures readability across various devices and screen sizes, making it an excellent choice for body text. Its geometric forms and friendly curves help maintain clarity even at smaller sizes, which is crucial for our diverse age group of users. Merriweather, a serif font, is used for headings to create a contrast, improving scannability and hierarchy. The combination enhances the overall readability and aesthetics of the site, adhering to typography theory by balancing legibility with character.

Color Scheme
Primary Colors: #005A9C (Vallejo Blue) and #F2F2F2 (Light Grey)
Accent Colors: #E63946 (Crimson) for calls to action and #FFD700 (Gold) for highlighting important features

Reasoning: The primary color, Vallejo Blue, represents trust, reliability, and calmness, aligning with the library's role as a trusted community resource. Light Grey is used for backgrounds to reduce strain on the eyes, ensuring content is comfortable to read for all ages. Crimson, as an accent color, draws attention to critical actions like signing up for a library card or reserving a book, leveraging color theory that red hues command attention. Gold highlights important information and navigational elements, offering a warm contrast that increases visibility and aesthetic appeal.

The chosen color palette uses a complementary color scheme with blue as the dominant color, supported by neutral grays and a warm accent. This scheme promotes a balance between warmth and coolness, creating an inviting yet professional online environment. The use of light backgrounds with darker text adheres to best practices for accessibility and readability, catering to the library's diverse user base.
